Does not currently support wrong 'casing' i.e if you write lagos state university instead of Lagos State
University, you will probably not get any result. Open to collaboration and ideas. I gladly welcome them!

The following would be imported and/or are required
*Developers access on twitter
*Tweepy(pip install tweepy)
*Requests(pip install requests)
*urllib.parse(pip install urllib.parse -called urlparse in python2.7 and lower)

Goodluck!

Warm regards,
with love.....
